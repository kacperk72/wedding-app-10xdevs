# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status

**Implementation started.** The repo now contains `wedding-planner/frontend` and `wedding-planner/backend`. The backend is Express + Supabase Postgres and verifies the external SSO JWT through JWKS; authentication credentials and passwords stay in the separate SSO/MySQL app.

Concrete artifacts present:
- `docs/demo-app/01..05-*.md` — full spec (overview, frontend, backend, database, milestones M0–M10).
- `docs/menu/*.pdf` — real catering offer (Pałac Polanka 2026) used as the model for the universal catering schema.
- `wedding-planner-koncepcja.md` — validation against course requirements.
- `wedding-planner-deployment.md` — deployment and SSO integration plan (authoritative for hosting and environment variables).
- `prompt-prototyp-ui.md` — original Lovable prompt used to generate the visual prototype.
- `.claude/skills/app-reverse-engineer/` — the custom skill used to reverse-engineer the Lovable prototype into the `docs/demo-app/` spec.

Note: specs live in `docs/demo-app/`; screenshots are under `docs/demo-app/screenshots/`.

## Current stack — read before referencing any doc

`docs/demo-app/` was originally written around NestJS + Supabase auth. The current target keeps the Supabase/Postgres database, but auth is externalized to the existing SSO service:

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Angular 20+ standalone + signals + SCSS (unchanged) |
| Backend | **Node.js + Express** on Hostinger Node.js app |
| Database | **Supabase Postgres** for all wedding-planner domain data |
| Auth | **External SSO at `kubitksso.pl`** — backend never sees passwords, only verifies RS256 JWT via JWKS (cached 1h). Sibling repo `SSO/` owns auth and uses MySQL internally. |
| Hosting | Hostinger Business: SPA via FTP to `wedding-planner-kubitk.pl`, backend as Node.js app on same host, database in Supabase |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions (FTP-Deploy for FE, SSH for BE) |

**Implication for the docs:** UI/data-model/feature scope in `docs/demo-app/` is authoritative. Anything about NestJS modules or local password auth is stale — translate to Express routes/services plus JWKS-verified SSO identity. PostgreSQL DDL, triggers, and Supabase migrations are valid for the wedding-planner database. RLS remains useful as a defense-in-depth option, but the backend currently uses a service-role Supabase client and enforces authorization in Express routes/services.

## Sources of truth (priority order, when conflicts arise)

1. **`wedding-planner-deployment.md`** — deployment, auth, hosting decisions.
2. **`docs/demo-app/04-database.md`** — data model. Per `05-implementation-plan.md`: if implementation forces a schema change, update this doc *first*, then the migration, then the code. Don't leave drift.
3. **`docs/demo-app/01-overview.md`** — feature scope. **Anything not on the page/flow list there is scope creep** — open a question at the end of that file instead of guessing.
4. **`docs/demo-app/02-frontend.md`** and **`03-backend.md`** — component inventory, endpoint shapes. Stale on framework choice (see Stack pivot) but accurate on UI structure and resource semantics.
5. The live Lovable prototype at `https://love-nest-co.lovable.app/` — fallback when docs are ambiguous. Report discrepancies, don't silently guess.

## Project-specific conventions

- **Polski UI is not optional.** Labels, statuses, mock data, dates (`DD.MM.YYYY`), currency (`32 000 zł` with space as thousands separator) must be Polish from the first commit. Easier to write in Polish than to migrate enums later.
- **Visual tokens (locked):** bottle green accent `~#3F5C3A`, cream background `~#FAF7EE`, serif headings (Cormorant/Playfair), sans body (Inter/DM Sans), `rounded-2xl`, subtle shadows. Put into `wedding-planner/frontend/src/styles/_tokens.scss` and never hardcode.
- **One wedding, two accounts, symmetric CRUD.** Wedding is a first-class entity with two members via `wedding_members`. Both partners have identical permissions *except* hard-delete of the wedding itself, which is gated by `weddings.created_by_user_id` (the "founder"). Do not introduce asymmetric permissions for anything else.
- **Catering configurator is universal.** Couples enter their own venue's offer (CRUD) — no global marketplace. The PDF in `docs/menu/` is the *modeling reference*, not a hardcoded fixture. Schema must accept any package-based catering offer.
- **Auto-task timeline.** Tasks tagged `auto` are generated backward from `weddings.wedding_date` using `task_templates`. Keep the Postgres trigger/function approach from `04-database.md` / Supabase migrations: date changes shift only unfinished auto tasks. Never touch completed tasks or manually-created tasks during regeneration; the operation must be idempotent.
- **Drag-and-drop needs a keyboard fallback.** Seating page uses `@angular/cdk/drag-drop`; an accessible alternative is a hard requirement, not a polish item.
- **Each milestone ships an end-to-end vertical slice.** M3 means "user sees the added guest in the UI", not "POST returns 201". Don't merge backend-only or frontend-only milestone completions.

## Resolved product decisions (don't relitigate)

From `05-implementation-plan.md` § Resolved decisions — already settled, don't propose alternatives unless the PO asks:
- Meal options live in a per-wedding `meal_options` table, edited in Settings, consumed as a dropdown in the guest editor.
- Symmetric partner CRUD; only `created_by_user_id` can hard-delete the wedding.
- JSON export is a full dump minus secrets (`password_hash`, invitation `token`).
- `diet` enum has 5 values: `pending` (default), `standard`, `vege`, `vegan`, `gluten_free`.
- Seating conflict reasons are free text.
- Meetings and tasks are independent entities — don't merge them in MVP.
- Hard-delete everywhere (no soft-delete in MVP).

## Working in this repo right now

The current scaffold lives under `wedding-planner/`. Backend commands run in `wedding-planner/backend`; frontend commands run in `wedding-planner/frontend`.

When asked to start implementation:
1. Continue from `docs/demo-app/05-implementation-plan.md`, adapted to the existing folders: `wedding-planner/frontend` and `wedding-planner/backend`.
2. Backend implementation uses Express routes/services, Supabase JS service-role client, and JWKS auth middleware. Do not add Sequelize/MySQL to wedding-planner; MySQL belongs to SSO only.
3. The data model in `04-database.md` (23 tables including the catering subsystem) is the contract. Schema changes must round-trip into the Supabase migration and that doc.

## Parent repo context

This directory is a git submodule-like sibling inside `C:\Users\kacpe\Desktop\Aplikacje\` (a multi-project apps workspace with its own `CLAUDE.md`). That parent `CLAUDE.md` describes other apps in the workspace (Budget App, Car App, Grave App, the older Fit Seats wedding-seating planner, etc.) and a generic Angular convention set. This wedding-planner project is **independent** of those — same author, but its own git remote (`wedding-app-10xdevs`) and its own product. Don't import code or patterns from sibling projects unless explicitly asked.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 5

Pick a deployment platform and ship to production with the **infra chain**:

```
(/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd  →  /10x-tech-stack-selector  →  /10x-bootstrapper  →  /10x-agents-md  →  /10x-rule-review  →  /10x-lesson)  →  /10x-infra-research  →  Plan Mode deploy
```

The full Module 1 chain ships from Lessons 1–4 (re-included so you can fix any earlier contract mid-flight). `/10x-infra-research` is the lesson's main topic; the deploy step itself uses the host's built-in **Plan Mode** rather than a dedicated skill — the artifact (`context/deployment/deploy-plan.md`) is what carries forward.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Infrastructure (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-infra-research [path-to-tech-stack-or-prd]` | You have a `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` (and ideally a `prd.md`) and need to pick an MVP deployment platform. The skill loads the stack as a hard constraint, runs a 5-question developer interview (persistent connections, cost sensitivity, existing familiarity, global reach, co-location preference), spawns parallel subagent research across six candidate platforms, scores them Pass/Partial/Fail across the five agent-friendly criteria from `references/agent-friendly-criteria.md`, shortlists the top three, and runs a three-lens anti-bias cross-check on the leader (devil's advocate, pre-mortem, unknown unknowns) before writing `context/foundation/infrastructure.md`. Use AFTER `/10x-tech-stack-selector`, BEFORE `/10x-implement`. |
| **Deploy (host built-in, not a skill)** | |
| Plan Mode deploy | You have `infrastructure.md` + `tech-stack.md` and want a read-only plan reviewed before any mutation hits the platform. Activate the host's plan mode (Claude Code: `Shift+Tab` cycles default → auto-accept → plan; IDE: dedicated button) with the prompt "Wykonajmy pierwsze wdrożenie w oparciu o `@infrastructure.md`, zgodnie ze stackiem z `@tech-stack.md`". Read the plan, demand corrections, approve, then let the agent execute. The approved plan persists at `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` so the next lesson's milestone planning can reference what's already deployed and which secrets are already wired. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-init` / `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-rule-review` / `/10x-lesson` / `/10x-stack-assess` / `/10x-health-check` | Bundled so you can patch any earlier contract mid-flight. If the anti-bias cross-check forces a platform swap that pushes a stack-shaped decision (e.g. "this DB doesn't fit any platform we'd accept"), re-run `/10x-tech-stack-selector` to keep `tech-stack.md` and `infrastructure.md` aligned. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-infra-research` reads `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` (language, framework, runtime, database) as **hard constraints** — platforms that can't run the stack are dropped before scoring. It also reads `context/foundation/prd.md` (scale, latency, uptime expectations) as **soft weights** when scoring. Both inputs are optional but strongly recommended; without them the skill proceeds but warns.
- The skill writes `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` as the third foundation contract: frontmatter (`project`, `researched_at`, `recommended_platform`, `runner_up`, `context_type`, `tech_stack`) plus a body covering recommendation, full platform comparison with scoring matrix, anti-bias findings, operational story (preview / secrets / rollback / approval / logs), and a risk register tying every entry back to the lens that surfaced it. On collision the skill prompts: overwrite, save as `infrastructure-v2.md`, or abort.
- Plan Mode reads `infrastructure.md` and `tech-stack.md` together. The agent emits a step-by-step plan covering automated steps it owns, manual setup gates (account creation, secret configuration), exact deploy commands (Pages vs Workers commands are NOT interchangeable on Cloudflare — the plan must specify), and verification steps. The plan is rejected/edited until it's right; only then does Plan Mode exit and execution begin. The approved plan lands at `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` and is consumed downstream by milestone-planning skills as ground truth for "what's already deployed".

### What the lesson's skills capture (and what they do NOT)

- **`/10x-infra-research` captures**: platform shortlist scored against five agent-friendly criteria (CLI quality, managed/serverless degree, agent-readable docs, stable/scriptable deploy API, MCP or first-class agent integration), three anti-bias outputs on the leader (numbered weaknesses, 150–200-word failure narrative, 3–5 unknown-unknowns), an operational story with one concrete answer per axis (not categories), and a risk register where every row names its source lens (`Devil's advocate` / `Pre-mortem` / `Unknown unknowns` / `Research finding`). Status of every non-GA feature is captured inline (`beta` / `preview` / `region-limited` / `deprecated`) with the date the status was checked.
- **`/10x-infra-research` does NOT** build Docker images or write Dockerfiles, configure CI/CD pipelines, or plan beyond MVP scope (multi-region HA is explicitly out of scope). It does NOT decide for you — the user accepts, swaps to runner-up, or aborts after the cross-check, and that decision is recorded in the output.
- **Plan Mode** captures: an explicit human gate between "agent has a plan" and "agent mutates production". The artifact (`deploy-plan.md`) is the audit trail for "what was supposed to happen" when the live run goes sideways. Plan Mode does NOT replace `/10x-infra-research` (the platform decision must already be made — Plan Mode plans the deploy, it doesn't pick where to deploy).

### The five agent-friendly criteria (and why they're load-bearing)

The criteria that make `/10x-infra-research`'s scoring matrix are not generic "good platform" axes — they're the specific traits that determine whether an agent can operate this platform from a session without you holding its hand:

1. **CLI-first** — every routine operation has a documented command; the agent doesn't need to click in a panel.
2. **Managed / serverless** — fewer moving pieces means fewer ways the agent (or you) breaks something the platform was supposed to handle.
3. **Agent-readable docs** — markdown / `llms.txt` / GitHub-hosted docs the agent can fetch and parse, not JS-rendered marketing pages.
4. **Stable, scriptable deploy API** — predictable exit codes, structured output, no interactive prompts mid-deploy.
5. **MCP server or first-class agent integration** — bonus, not required. CLI alone is fine for MVP; MCP earns its keep when the agent makes dozens of structured queries against live state.

Hard filters apply before scoring (persistent-connection requirement drops Netlify/Vercel serverless-only; tech-stack runtime mismatch drops the platform entirely). Interview answers reweight criteria after — cost sensitivity penalizes expensive base tiers, familiarity breaks ties, global-reach preference favours edge-native platforms, co-location preference favours integrated databases.

### Anti-bias as a decision discipline (not theatre)

Every research conversation with an LLM has a built-in tilt toward whatever the user already signalled. `/10x-infra-research` runs three structured lenses against the leader BEFORE the file is written, not after:

- **Devil's advocate** — *find the weaknesses, hidden costs, and failure modes specific to deploying `<this stack>` on `<this platform>`*. Output is a numbered list of 3–5 specifics, not categories.
- **Pre-mortem** — *six months later, this decision turned out to be a complete disaster; walk through the assumptions and underestimated risks that led there*. Output is a 150–200-word narrative; narratives surface concrete failure shapes that abstract risk lists hide.
- **Unknown unknowns** — *what's true about this combination that the marketing page and docs don't make obvious?* Output is 3–5 non-obvious risks.

After the cross-check the user has three real options: **proceed with the leader and absorb the risks into the register**, **swap to runner-up** (and re-run the cross-check on the new leader), or **swap to third place**. The third option is rare; if it never happens across many runs, the cross-check has degraded into a ritual and should be rewritten.

Two additional techniques (no skill required, raw prompts) belong in the same toolbox: forcing the model to compare three alternatives in a markdown table (structure beats "the same answer in different words"), and role-rotation (the same decision through a frontend dev's, security person's, and cost owner's eyes — surface the cost each role pays and propose alternatives if any of them flinch).

### CLI vs MCP for live-infra operability

After deploy, the agent needs a way to talk to the running platform. Two paths, complementary not competing:

- **CLI** (`wrangler`, `flyctl`, `vercel`, `gh`) — explicit and auditable, output stays in the terminal, safer defaults for irreversible actions (e.g. `netlify deploy` is draft by default; `--prod` must be passed). Best for MVP: minimal setup, low context cost (no tool schemas pre-loaded), and the agent has to know the command (which is where a per-tool skill helps).
- **MCP** — a dedicated server exposing structured tools with schemas (`pages_deployments_list`, etc.). Each connected MCP server adds tool definitions to the context window, so cost compounds across servers. Earns its keep when the agent makes many discovery-style queries against live state (logs, deployment diffs) and structured JSON beats parsing CLI output.

Sensible default: start with CLI, add MCP when you notice a recurring pattern of `--help` traversal the agent has to do to answer a class of questions. Anthropic's own [building-agents-that-reach-production](https://claude.com/blog/building-agents-that-reach-production-systems-with-mcp) framing is "API, CLI, and MCP are three complementary paths" — pick by task, not by hype.

### Production-access boundary (minimal permissions, human-on-irreversibles)

Both CLI and MCP can give the agent direct access to production. The lesson sets a default posture:

- **Tokens are scoped, not master keys.** On Cloudflare: an API token limited to Pages or Workers for one project, no DNS, no Workers Secrets for unrelated projects, no billing. AWS / GCP equivalent: scoped IAM role with `console-only-user` or read-only on production, full access on staging.
- **Tokens live in env vars, not in `.mcp.json` committed to the repo.** The agent picks them up via the MCP server or CLI's env-discovery, not via plaintext in conversation.
- **Destructive actions are human-only.** Drop a database, rotate a primary secret, delete a project — those are panel-by-hand operations, even if the agent suggests them. Manual click costs 30 seconds; cleanup after an automated mistake costs hours.

This is the MVP posture. As the project matures, the natural evolution is staging gets full agent access, production becomes read-only — covered in later modules.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — input (Lesson 2 hand-off, hard constraints)
- `context/foundation/prd.md` — input (Lesson 1 hand-off, soft weights)
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` — output (the third foundation contract)
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` — output of Plan Mode deploy (audit trail of "what was supposed to happen")
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls (use `/10x-lesson` from Lesson 4 if you spot a class of agent failure during research or deploy)
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry

### Universal language

The shipped skill carries no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The candidate platform list (Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, Fly.io, Railway, Render) is the starting research lens, not a recommendation set — the scoring + interview + cross-check pipeline is what's load-bearing, and a platform absent from the default list can be added by extending the research step. The five agent-friendly criteria are the artifact's true core; `/10x-infra-research` re-reads them from `references/agent-friendly-criteria.md` so they evolve as platforms do.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
